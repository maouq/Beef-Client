To start you need discord.py==1.7.3

Step 1:
  1. Start with "pip uninstall discord.py" or "pip3 uninstall discord.py"
  2. It'll ask Y/N, say y, if it doesn't continue to the next step

Step 2: 
  1. Do "pip install discord.py==1.7.3" or "pip3 install discord.py==1.7.3" in your terminal/command prompt

Step 3:
  1. Create a folder and drag it into Visual Studio Code
  2. Create a file called bot.py then from our bot.py insert the code
  3. At the bottom where it says "client.run("token here", bot=False)" replace "token here" with your discord token

Step 4: 
  Option 1: Just run the file from Visual Studio Code
  Option 2: CD to your folder, if you do it from Visual Studio Code, it will be CD on default, then do "python bot.py" or "python3 bot.py"

Step 5:
  Go to a Discord chat, and start off by saying ",help" and you'll see a list of the basic commands
